OK, so we've got this idea for a school. Not a school really, just a group of families playing and learning together, in all sorts of different ways -- but with goals and some planning and evaluating to reach them. Maybe you should move to our wonderful little town and let's do this together. 

There's no educational theory dogma here. Our daughter is 5. We've been "homeschooling," but really it's just playing and creating with conscious attention to reading, writing, math, science, history, liturature and a lot of other. There's no sitting down and doing boring stuff. Why slow her down like that? We learn history on the kitchen floor, with our hands and our history books getting covered with clay. 

We are looking for other families to join us. When the kids get older, we'll pool resources (according to ability) to pay for language tutors, music teachers and other needs. We believe it's natural and easy for kids to learn several languages fluently before they're done with their teens. It just takes exposure. We've seen this happen around the world, and regret we didn't get that exposure our selves.
