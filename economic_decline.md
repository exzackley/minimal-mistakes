A new politics is possible and necessary in America. The Ralph Nader's suggested "left-libertarian alliance" is not quite it. That was the alliance behind the American Revolution and so many revolts before and after. Today, though, we have a new problem -- one for which neither the American libertarian right nor the "small is beautiful" left has a solution.

The problem is systemic economic decline -- something we've never faced before in our history. Decline actually began between 100 and 40 years ago, depending on whether you start the clock at the earliest root causes or the onset of acute symptoms. Before 1977, America suffered scores of economic crisis -- some so severe as to cause mass unemployment or even famine. Until the Great Depression, the crises were relatively short -- messy train-wrecks of overproduction and/or speculation. It was never that long before the tracks were cleared and the trains were running once again.    

The growth of the North American economy astounded the world -- starting basically from the moment Europeans landed at Plymouth right up until our grand finale of economic mobilization in World War II. Then, the torch of rampant growth passed to Asia.
