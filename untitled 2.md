In every community, in every part of the world, in every era, a few people feel compelled to work, sacrifice and/or meddle in everyone's business for the good of everyone -- or for the good of some ideal. If you picked up this book, I'm assuming you're one of them. I am too. We've got some things to figure out. 

First of all, why are we like this? Most people are fine to let the world take care of itself. Maybe they don't like some of the things the government or big banks are doing, but they would never consider in a million years doing anything about it. That's because they are not weird, like us. They very logically feel that it is in their own self-interest to  



In the 21st century, in the United States, how does our compulsion   

Up until seven or eight thousand years ago, everyone on earth lived in tiny, independent, self-governing groups. People like you cared for the sick and defended the weak. You smoothed conflicts between family and friends. You counseled peace in tensions with foreign groups. After war, you protected the prisoners.  

Your entire society was only about 100 people, a self-governing political unit with no formal leaders. The group made its living directly by gathering plants and hunting animals on land that it controlled. Everyone participated in both economics and politics. Major decisions were made in open discussions. In those debates, voices like yours were essential not only for the survival of the species, but also for making life good. 

I'm not saying it was utopia. In some places and times there was horrible violence between groups. Human culture grew in a thousand different directions -- some of them unpleasant. I'm not making a   but you were free.  

Then came agriculture. Over a few thousand years, through a process I'll describe later, most of humanity was enslaved, losing access to land of their own. Everything they grew, they delivered to the elites' granaries at spear-point. The community of all the people was replaced by a community among elites that was fed and clothed by the majority of the people who were excluded from the community. 

Because the evil of this system was so transparent, people frequently rebelled against it. Occasionally, some rebels would find themselves at the head of an army large enough to defeat the elite. If that was you, you instituted reforms to improve the lives of the people. You could not, however, return the land to the people without also giving up your army -- and your army was the only thing preventing the old elite from taking back over. Elites came in all different forms ranging from absolute monarchs to citizen democracies.  

 

Then the political community of all the people made a comeback -- in a few commercial cities. Formerly-excluded people -- who found that cities and industrialization gave them new power -- fought their way into the community using every means available. Urban merchant elites opened up rather than face rebellion -- besides, they were upstarts themselves, and didn't rely on slavery the way their agricultural and aristocratic counterparts did. They were partly illusory, since much of their living, like ours, came from slaves, just not their slaves. 

Not everyone's voices counted the same. Not everyone's lives were valued the same. But in certain cities, everyone had certain basic rights. To us, they would seem minimal, but they meant the world to the people who had them. More important for the story I'm trying to tell, 

No complex systems of exploitation needed to be overturned. That's not because people were nicer back then, or less sophisticated, but because there was simply nothing to exploit out of them. All people made their living by gathering plants and killing animals. That stuff didn't keep -- and anyways, there was no where to keep it. What about wealth? There wasn't any. If you liked something your friend had, it was easy to make or find one yourself. If you complimented her on it, she'd probably give it to you on the spot. 

It was no utopia. When a stronger group wanted a resource that belonged to a weaker one, genocide was often the next step. You pleaded with your people not to go there. 








We weren't "primitive" then. We were modern humans. We spoke languages just as complex as today's, and we spoke them better. We all lived like 18th century aristocrats -- working only a few hours a day, filling our days with stories, songs, poetry and debates -- just without the horses, castles and serfs, but with about the same life expectancy.    

It was no utopia. When a stronger group wanted a resource that belonged to a weaker one, genocide was often the next step. You would plead with your people not to go there. 

Even hundreds of thousands of years ago, when we were still developing language, we had already distinguished ourselves as high tech revolutionaries by using fire, animal skins, stone tools and long-range spear-throwers to explore new worlds where no primate had gone before as far away from our origins in Africa as Siberia and South East Asia. We were astronauts.  

Even after hundreds of thousands of years of exploring the planet, inventing all sorts of fancy tools and weapons, creating religions and infinite volumes of epic poetry, however, we still did not know how to exploit each other. As of ten thousand years ago, there were no armies, no kings, no peasants, no workers and no masters.

That changed only with the invention of agriculture. Even then, it took thousands of years to turn the potential of exploitation into a reality. The whole world did not suddenly become a feudal manor. Even today, some people can still claim that their ancestors have never had a run-in with post-agricultural exploitation. 

Over thousands of years, as agriculture spread across the globe, infinite variations of political structures evolved and devolved. The first agricultural people lived in self-reliant, relatively egalitarian communities. Eventually, though, new kinds of societies emerged in which most people were essentially slaves. These slaves, serfs, peasants or whatever you want to call them, no longer had access to land of their own. All the land was controlled by someone else -- someone with an army. People could no longer gather plants and hunt animals freely for themselves. Instead, they raised domesticated plants and animals to be handed over, at spear-point, to the guy with the army. 

The story wasn't over when this state of exploitation was first achieved. Every chiefdom, kingdom and empire eventually fell. Sometimes they were instantly replaced by another, but sometimes the people got their land back, and reverted to self-government. 

Therefore, the memory of freedom was never far off. And maybe those reminders were not necessary: Farmers planted seeds, watched them grow, harvested crops, and delivered them to the kings' granaries, even sometimes as their own families starved. Complex systems of tradition and belief supported all of this ideologically -- but could anyone have ever really lost their desire to regain control over the land for their own communities? 

In the parts of the world where history was first recorded in writing, such as China, India, the Middle East and Rome, we have a long record of frequent peasant uprisings. Even though rebels almost never won and usually paid with their lives, they rebelled anyways. Apparently, it is impossible to extinguish human beings' desire for the freedom to make a living. 

Occasionally, some rebels would find themselves at the head of an army large enough to defeat a king or emperor. Occasionally, they instituted reforms to improve the lives of the people. They could not, however, end exploitation altogether. Exploitation is what fed their own army, and their army was the only thing preventing someone else's army from coming in and conquering. 

That cycle of rebellion and reform was an important one. It created a floor to the mistreatment that rulers could get away with. It was a very low floor, and one that only applied in certain times and places, but it nevertheless saved countless millions from unspeakable horrors. 

As empires spread, so did the great global religions, almost like parasites, using the empires as host organisms. They spread using the empires' common tongues, writing technology, transportation systems, legal protections and bureaucracies. They usually began by challenging the empires' very right to exist, later settling for heighten standards of decency -- or at least lip service in that direction.

For several thousand years, humanity seemed to be locked forever in that stalemate. There seemed to be no way the people would ever get their land back.     


The freedom to make a living, freely, is  


their produce being appropriated by leaders to feed the army that kept the system in place -- and conquered new lands, converting more of humanity over to the way of exploitation. 

In that way, most of humanity eventually came to live under conditions of explpoitation.

It couldn't happen simply because everyone had unfettered access to the means of making a living, because they had access to the land, plants and animals -- the only living they knew.

Today, however, the vast majority of the people on earth are cut off from access to land, plants and animals. They're also cut off from the modern means of making a living: machines, information, capital. 

Take me, for example. I'm way up in the top few percent of income earners in the world (so, almost certainly, are you). But I don't own capital (again, you're probably in the same boat). My family's entire savings provides close to zero interest, and it would last us about a year or two if we had to live on it -- thanks only to a low, midwestern rural cost of living.  

Therefore, to feed myself, my wife and my kid, I have to go out, hat in hand, begging to someone who controls some capital to let me use some of it. Any value I produce with it belongs to the owners. They keep what I make and give me whatever I get in my salary. 

I have been lucky to work for a bunch of great companies and organizations and am grateful to have been given access to their capital. But I -- like you -- have always lived with a sense of acute insecurity, knowing that if my employer doesn't like me anymore, or goes out of business, or the economy contracts -- that I may wind up without access to capital anymore. (As a 44 year old who works in tech, I find I'm feeling more and more insecure with each birthday!)
