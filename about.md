We're hoping to attract homeschooling families who share our approach and goals to join us in our town. On the other hand, if this site connects us to a community somewhere else, maybe we'll join you!   

We are having a blast home schooling our five year old daughter. She is learning so much, so quickly. It will soon be hard for us to keep up. We are looking for a few other home schooling families with a similar approach as us who want to collaborate on learning projects, share expertise, spend time together, and in the future, pool resources to hire language teachers (unless you're able to be the language teacher -- even better!)

## Some reasons to move to Crane

Crane is a beautiful little town where you can renew your tags at the DMV in less than a minute, unless you feel like sticking around and chatting. You can buy a five million dollar San Francisco mansion here for $150,000. Or a nice little two bedroom for less than most people paid for their car. 

If you can work remotely from a job somewhere else, the low cost of living here and the lack of any commute makes family life here a joy. Once a few of you get here, we'll open a co-working space and a coffee shop downtown -- how about that?  

Other wonderful things about Crane: 

- Awesome town pool
- Skate park
- Amazing sledding hill
- Many places to hike and camp nearby
- Branson is less than an hour away!
- World class Pizza in nearby Reed Springs
- The Crane Creek
- Playgrounds and parks
- A whole bunch of "antique stores"
- A couple of great restaurants
- Springfield Missouri is 40 minutes away with all of civilization's accouterments: hipster coffee shops, clothing stores, museums, minor league baseball, a great skating rink, a mall and tons more.  
- And last but not least: The world famous Crane Broiler Festival
